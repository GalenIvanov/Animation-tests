# Animation dialect for Red


# Ideas for future work
There are many things that can be added to the animation system:

## Animation control
- pause
- resume
- stop
- rewind
- ffd

## Text-fx to work on specified parts of text
Now it works on all components, depending on the mode - lines, words or characters. It would be good to specify which ones to animate. Possible parameters: index, range, or block of indices.

## Frames - an effect that changes the content of an image frame by frame

## 2d Arrays
- rectangular
- polar

## Parallax effect
